# planwright

`planwright` is a SQL project for Databases. It turns validate indexing choices with sqlite3 fixtures and plan expectations into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Planwright

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Files Worth Reading

- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `schema.sql`: sqlite schema and view definitions

## What It Does

- Includes extended examples for fixture rows, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents constraint behavior tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Design Sketch

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The SQL project uses sqlite fixtures, views, and assertions to keep query behavior inspectable.

## Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Fixture Notes

`boundary` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `review` path with a score of 142. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at 28 and `recovery` at 266, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Next Directions

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more databases fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Limits

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.
